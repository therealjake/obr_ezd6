TODOS

- Start characters with a coinbag
- Rework the basic roller to be smart like the save roller
- Revisit roll synching - save roller is not synching at all now
- Maybe - some kind of save/import feature
- Maybe keep die roll history whne you close the roller
- Support allies with a max-health other than 2
- Support "other" items that don't count towards encumberance (rings etc)
- Consider allowing the characters more item slots
